 * Description
 * 
 * Background The knight is getting bored of seeing the same black and white squares again and again and has decided to make a journey around the
 * world. Whenever a knight moves, it is two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to this. The world of a knight is the chessboard he
 * is living on. Our knight lives on a chessboard that has a smaller area than a regular 8 * 8 board, but it is still rectangular. Can you help this
 * adventurous knight to make travel plans?
 * 
 * Problem Find a path such that the knight visits every square once. The knight can start and end on any square of the board. Input
 * 
 * The input begins with a positive integer n in the first line. The following lines contain n test cases. Each test case consists of a single line
 * with two positive integers p and q, such that 1 <= p * q <= 26. This represents a p * q chessboard, where p describes how many different square
 * numbers 1, . . . , p exist, q describes how many different square letters exist. These are the first q letters of the Latin alphabet: A, . . .
 * Output
 * 
 * The output for every scenario begins with a line containing "Scenario #i:", where i is the number of the scenario starting at 1. Then print a
 * single line containing the lexicographically first path that visits all squares of the chessboard with knight moves followed by an empty line. The
 * path should be given on a single line by concatenating the names of the visited squares. Each square name consists of a capital letter followed by
 * a number. If no such path exist, you should output impossible on a single line. Sample Input
 * 
 * 3 1 1 2 3 4 3 Sample Output
 * 
 * Scenario #1: A1
 * 
 * Scenario #2: impossible
 * 
 * Scenario #3: A1B3C1A2B4C2A3B1C3A4B2C4
